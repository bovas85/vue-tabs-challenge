This is just a quick app rushed to produce something similar to what I sent in React 2 days ago.

I've reused most of the code from React while adapting it to Vue and optimising it to be SSR ready.

A similar approach can be done using Next.js.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
# service worker is disabled in dev
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
