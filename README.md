This is just a quick app rushed to produce something similar to what I sent in React 2 days ago.

I've reused most of the code from React while adapting it to Vue and optimising it to be SSR ready.

A similar approach can be done using Next.js.

## Summary of the test

For this code challenge, I will create a section of a landing page that displays the offerings from . It will include 3 tabbed sections that automatically switches tabs until the user navigates to a tab on their own. On mobile, it simply provides 3 sections with horizontal scrolling.

## Requirements

- Matches Design
- Responsive
- Automatically swaps tabs
  - Progress bar shows time until swap
  - Pauses when the links are not in the viewport
- Clicking a tab link swaps to the tab
  - This also stops the auto swapping
- Mobile shows all 3 sections with horizontal scrolling


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
# service worker is disabled in dev
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
